I believe that having a quality website is crucial for small businesses. As consumers continue to turn to the Internet for information, businesses should seek to be there with a website that will win over these potential customers.

There are several key characteristics that we believe in when designing websites:

Easy to Navigate – people want ease of use, so your website should be simple to navigate.

**Clean** – cluttered websites will confuse and potentially scare away consumers, so we keep our designs clean.

**Professional** – a website is a reflection of your business, so it needs to be professional in order to instill confidence in the consumer.

**Reflective of the Brand** – your website should be in line with your brand so that it is easily recognizable to the consumer (logo, color scheme, font types, tone, imagery, etc.).

**Informational** – consumers are seeking information when they visit your website, so it is important to make that information readily available and easy to find.

**Responsive Design** – as consumers increasingly view websites on mobile devices, your website should look good and be easy to use on these devices.

Prolific Marketing not only offers the design of new websites, but also the updating of current websites as well as ongoing management of websites.
